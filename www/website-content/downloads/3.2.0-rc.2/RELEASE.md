Dear community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation I am proud to announce that Haxe 3.2.0-rc2 is now officially released! It is available along with the changelog at <http://haxe.org/download>.

This release introduces the new Python target which was developed by Heinz HÃ¶lzer and Dan Korostelev. As with any new target it should be considered to be in beta stage.

Another new feature is the static analyzer which can be activated by compiling with -D analyzer. It applies various optimizations such as constant propagation and expression-level DCE which improves the quality of the generated code on targets such as JavaScript. We plan to make this a default setting in the future once the implementation has stabilized.

There are quite a few other new features, improvements and bugfixes, so make sure to check out the changelog. We addressed many issues that are present in Haxe 3.1.3!

Haxe 3.2.0 is going to have a few breaking changes. While we try to avoid these in general, there are situations where that's not feasible. We have prepared an overview of the breaking changes at <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/wiki/Breaking-changes-in-Haxe-3.2.0>.

Please test your Haxe code with this version and let us know if you come across any problems at <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues>. We plan to have the next release very soon, so make sure to get your issue reports in!

Thank you for your support

		<p class="lead">Haxe gives you a powerful language and useful libraries for writing both server-side and client-side code.</p>
		<p><b>On the client</b>, you can target HTML 5 with Haxe's JavaScript target.  Haxe's strict type system means you catch errors at compile-time, and can maintain large code bases with confidence.  You can interact with existing JS libraries using externs.  You can also create SWFs for interactive media targeting the Flash Player.</p>
		<p><b>On the server</b>, you can target PHP (for cheap hosting), Neko (for massive speed increases), or NodeJS for access to the massive NodeJS repository of libraries and tools.  You can also use Haxe's macro powered DB Records to sync your Haxe objects with your database.</p>
		<p><b>Best of all</b>, your client-side code and your server-side code can use the same language, sharing common code, and communicating effortlessly via Haxe Remoting.</p>

		<h1>Linux Software Packages</h1>
		The Haxe Foundation officially participates in the maintenance of Haxe and Neko packages for a number of popular Linux distributions. It is recommended to use those packages whenever available.

		<h2>Ubuntu</h2>
		<p>Ubuntu, being a downstream project of Debian, inherits the Haxe and Neko Debian packages. However, due to the long release cycle of Ubuntu and Debian, it is very likely that those packages are outdated.</p>

		<p>We recommend you to use our Personal Package Archive (PPA), <a href="https://launchpad.net/~haxe/+archive/ubuntu/releases" target="_blank">ppa:haxe/releases</a>, which provides the latest versions of Haxe and Neko for all the currently supported Ubuntu versions. To install Haxe and Neko using the PPA, run the commands as follows:</p>
		<pre>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:haxe/releases -y
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install haxe -y
mkdir ~/haxelib &amp;&amp; haxelib setup ~/haxelib</pre>
		<p>Neko will be installed as a dependency of Haxe.</p>
		<p>Note that the PPA is also usable for Ubuntu based distributions, e.g. Linux Mint.</p>

		<h2>Debian</h2>
		<p>The Haxe Foundation continuously updates the Haxe and Neko packages in the Debian archive. However, due to the long release cycle of Debian. It is very likely that only the packages in the testing channel and the unstable (sid) channel are up-to-date.</p>
		<p>To check the currently available versions in various channels, check the pages as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=haxe" target="_blank">Haxe in Debian</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=neko" target="_blank">Neko in Debian</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>To install the currently available versions for your system, simply run the commands as follows:</p>
		<pre>sudo apt-get install haxe -y
mkdir ~/haxelib &amp;&amp; haxelib setup ~/haxelib</pre>
		<p>Neko will be installed as a dependency of Haxe.</p>
		<p>Consult the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences" target="_blank">APT Preferences article</a> if you want to use the packages in the testing/unstable channels.

		<h2>Fedora</h2>
		<p>The Haxe Foundation maintains the Haxe and Neko RPM packages in the Fedora repository. The packages are up-to-date most of the time. However, when a new version of Haxe is released, it will take a few days, up to 2 weeks, to push an updated package to the stable releases of Fedora. The update activities can be tracked in the <a href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=haxe" target="_blank">Bodhi Fedora Update System</a>.</p>
		<p>To install the currently available versions for your system, simply run the commands as follows:</p>
		<pre>sudo dnf install haxe -y
mkdir ~/haxelib &amp;&amp; haxelib setup ~/haxelib</pre>
		<p>Neko will be installed as a dependency of Haxe.</p>

		<h2>openSUSE</h2>
		<p>The Haxe Foundation has a devel project, named <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:languages:haxe" target="_blank">devel:languages:haxe</a>, in the openSUSE Build Service. The project provides the latest versions of Haxe and Neko for all the currently supported openSUSE versions.</p>
		<p>To install Haxe and Neko from the devel project, visit the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:haxe/haxe" target="_blank">Haxe package page</a>, click "Download package" at the top-right corner and follow the instruction there. Neko will be installed as a dependency of Haxe.</p>
